This is a personal project to test ideas, system designs and techs.


## Running

Before running, must create the database and populate it with dummy registers. For that, just type while in the project's root directory:

```bash
$ ./db/create-db.sh <DB_NAME> <DB_USER> <DB_PWD>
```

After that, from the same position, start the server:

```bash
./app/run.sh
```
